Created in 2022, the [South Side Science Festival](https://southsidescience.event.uchicago.edu/) brings the South Side and UChicago communities together for a day of fun outdoor science exploration, inspiring exchanges with faculty and student researchers, live experiments and demonstrations, food, and music.

Each year, the public can meet some of the scientists conducting top research on the South Side; talk to grad students about why they chose science; and fire up imaginations around the possibilities of STEM.

As part of the [Diversity and Inclusion Committee](https://bsd-medphys.prod.uchicago.edu/page/diversity-and-inclusion) for the Graduate Program in Medical Physics, we shared a collection of medical physics demos. These included ultrasound, MRI, and CT imaging demos, along with radiation therapy demos.
