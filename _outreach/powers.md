Hosted by UCSB's Association for Women in Mathematics ([AWM](https://awm-math.org/)), POWERS (Problem sOlving for Women to Encourage Research in STEM) Day aims to empower women pursuing careers in STEM fields. Throughout the day, there are talks and activities about math, physics, computer science, and more. [POWERS Day](https://powersday.thisiscool.com/) aims to make role models available to girls and provide information about STEM workplaces to empower the next generation of women in STEM careers.

As President of the the [UCSB AWM Chapter](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/~awm/index.html) and part of the POWERS Day organizing committee, I organized the [2020 POWERS Day](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/mathcircle/powersday.html) and [2019 POWERS Day](https://powersday.thisiscool.com/).
