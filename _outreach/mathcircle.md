[Math Circle](https://web.math.ucsb.edu/mathcircle/) is a unique program that accessibly introduces abstract mathematics by exploring its beauty while also developing and improving commonly used mathematical skills and problem solving tactics.

The program consists of monthly sessions lead by UCSB undergraduates and either local or visiting faculty. Each session consists of a group activity that examines a piece of a given mathematical field, striving to give opportunity for exploration of abstract thinking rather than math that is solely calculation based. Together, the students work on understanding and solving these problems and work through the challenges that come with these concepts in unity. Our goal is to give the young women of Santa Barbara an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals who also share their love of math, and to build a community that will give them the role models and support they need to pursue mathematics in the future.

From 2019-2020, I organized the math circle sessions. On October 11th, 2019, I lead a crytography session. I introduced middle school students to the group theoretic principles behind crytography through the use of food coloring.
