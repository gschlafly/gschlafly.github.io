[Splash! Chicago](https://splashchicago.learningu.org) is a community service organization dedicated to providing unique and fun academic enrichment programs to high school students in the greater Chicago area. We hope to give high school students, particularly students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, a chance to explore fields they are interested in, UChicago, and the idea of going to college.

We bring together UChicago students with a passion they want to share and Chicagoland high schoolers who want to learn! We do this by hosting fun and free events where Chicago students teach about what they love. We generally host two one-day events, Droplet and Splash, in the autumn and winter. We also host a weekly program in the spring, Cascade, that lasts for five weeks.
We hope to give high school students a chance to explore fields they are interested in, UChicago, and the idea of going to college. For UChicago students, we want to provide a platform for students to share what they’re interested in, and to give grad-school-bound students a chance to practice teaching.
We’re part of a huge network of Splash programs hosted at universities across the country! Splash Chicago was one of the four founding members of this network!
