I am a PhD student in the [Medical Physics](https://medphys.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago working under the advisement of [Dr. Patrick La Riviere](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/patrick-j-la-riviere-phd) and [Dr. Rudolf Oldenbourg](https://www.mbl.edu/research/faculty-and-whitman-scientists/Rudolf%20Oldenbourg). I study tomogarphy techniques for polarized light microscopy, with a particular interest in characterizing the 3D birefringence of anisotropic objects using light field microscopy. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and making ceramics.
